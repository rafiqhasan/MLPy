When we implement a machine learning algorithm we need to monitor a few points:
1. Bias Vs Variance
2. If the implementation of your model is High Biased then we need to add more parameters or increase the degree of model used
3. If the implementation of your model is High Varianced then we need to add regularization parameter or decrease the degree of model used

In this part of the implementation we will be using Validation and Learning curves to monitor the progress and efficiency of our learning model.

You will have the following objective
1. Plot learning curve to measure Bias Vs Variance
2. Model to be used( 1, 2, 3 ... ) 
3. Regularization parameter estimation
4.
