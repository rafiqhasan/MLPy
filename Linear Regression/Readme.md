Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be depending on the size of the house and the number
of bedrooms in the house. 

One way to do this is to collect information on recent houses sold and train an AI model of housing prices. Once the model is trained we
will use that model to predict the price of a house on the basis of house size and number of rooms.

In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses.
