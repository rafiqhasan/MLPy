# PythonMLCoursera
Firstly, my heartiest thanks to Professor Andrew Ng.

The purpose of this project is to implement the course exercises given in Machine learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, on Python.

You must be aware that the course has been outlined and explained completely on Octave or MATLAB due to their ease of implementation for mathematical problems, however Python is suited as the best language to implement Machine learning problems because of its capabilities to create Web APIs, easy integration, dynamism and faster processing etc.

Hence the secondary focus of this project is to try sticking to as much as possible Octave-like and easy implementation of the codes, for everyone to be able to relate to the Coursera ML course by Andrew Ng.

Important points:

1. The project is still ongoing and I will continue uploading the solutions for further weeks.

2.The implementations may not be exactly on the approach as asked in the course exercises, since the main objective is to achieve the   solution of the problem. However the solution to the problem will be the same.
