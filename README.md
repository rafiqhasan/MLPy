# MLPy
Firstly, my heartiest thanks to Professor Andrew Ng for his open contributions to ML.

The purpose of this project is to implement Machine learning in python using the data and problem reference of ML course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

The secondary focus of this project is to try sticking to as much as possible Octave-like and easy implementation of the codes, for everyone to be able to relate to the Coursera ML course by Andrew Ng.

Linear Regression - Prediction
Logistic Regression - Classification
Neural learning - Classification & Prediction
K-means Clustering - Unlabeled classification

Important points:

1. The project is still ongoing.

2. The implementations may not be exactly on the approach as given in the coursera course exercises, since the main objective is to achieve the solution of the problem. However the solution to the problem will be the same.

Implementation notes:

1. At various places in the code I have written " if 1 == 2 " , that is just to turn on/off certain parts of codes like showing a graph or picturizing the dataset. You can turn it on with " if 1 == 1".

2. Feel free to clone the GIT and contribute !
