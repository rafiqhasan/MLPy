# ML_Py
Firstly, my heartiest thanks to Professor Andrew Ng for his open contributions to ML.

The purpose of this project is to implement Machine learning in python using the data and problem statement reference of ML course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

1. Linear Regression - Prediction
2. Logistic Regression - Classification
3. Neural learning - Classification & Prediction
4. K-means Clustering - Unlabeled classification
5. Anomaly detection

Important points:

1. The project is still ongoing.

2. The implementations may not be exactly on the approach as given in the coursera course exercises, since the main objective is to achieve the solution of the problem. However the solution to the problem will be the same.

Implementation notes:

1. At various places in the code I have written " if 1 == 2 " , that is just to turn on/off certain parts of codes like showing a graph or picturizing the dataset. You can turn it on with " if 1 == 1".

2. I have tried to stick to as much as possible Octave-like and easy implementation of the codes, for those people to be able to relate easily, who have already attended the Coursera ML course by Andrew Ng.

3. Feel free to clone the GIT and contribute !
