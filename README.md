# PythonMLCoursera
The purpose of this project is to implement the course exercises given in Machine learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

Firstly, my heartiest thanks to Professor Andrew Ng.

You must be aware that the course has been outlined and explained completely on Octave or MATLAB due to its ease of code for mathematical problems, however Python is suited as the best language to implement Machine learning problems because of its capabilities to create Web APIs, easy integration etc.

Hence the secondary focus of this project is to try to stick onto as much easy and Octave-like implementation of the codes as possible, for everyone to understand and relate to the Coursera ML course by Andrew Ng.

Important points:

The project is still ongoing and I will continue uploading the solutions for further weeks.

The implementations may not be exactly on the approach as asked in the course exercises, since the main objective is to achieve the solution of the problem. However the solution to the problem will be the same.
